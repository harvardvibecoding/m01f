This project contains the instructor's solution to the previous unit, where we vibe-coded a Python program (`trends_plot.py`) that reads the CSV file produced by `trends_save.py` and produces a plot in `interest_data.png`. The learner's task in this project is to vibe-code:

*  changes to `trends_save.py` and
*  a new Python program (`my_tool.py`) that combines the existing Python programs into a single tool.
